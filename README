A just-for-fun project for approximating an "operating system" for the original Game Boy.

Goals:
	Time-sharing scheduler
	Negotiation of access to shared resources
		eg. vram, audio, input
	IPC
	task spawning
	sleep()

Stretch goals:
	Text interface application
	Split screen access to vram

Non goals:
	Full state switching (eg. all io regs, vram, ...) to allow 'bare metal' programs to run
	Security - all programs must obey the rules but if they don't we can't stop them
